# B-spline-curvature-
This work visualises the curvature surface plot of bsplines across knots via Deep Learning vs centripetal heuristic. The videos below correspond to clamped B-splines with 4 points. The training file 2D-unsupervised-optimisation.ipynb deals with unsupervised traninng for B-splines interpolation for only 4 points. Training noteooks and neural nets for 5,6,7,8 points will be uploaded soon.
